# My dotfiles 

## dotfiles

I forked the initial version of these dotfiles from holman/dotfiles and reworked
it significantly for my own tastes.

Most importantly this version uses Debian (currently Jessie) as opposed to OSX
from the original.

It is most likely a better idea to check the project at
https://github.com/holman/dotfiles as I cannot guarantee I will always be
keeping this up to date with any fixes or even following best practices for
keeping this repo clean. Zach Holman's project has much more public attention
and curation than I expect to ever draw with a branch so please go check his
repo.

## Install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adobley/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

Other than this, see README.md.old for the README from the time of forking.

Major thanks to Zach Holman and all those whose dotfiles I've looked at over the
years. This implementation is much better than my old dotfile management.
